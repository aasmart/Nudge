# Nudge
Nudge is driven by the fact that being sedentary for extended periods of time is not healthy. In modern times, it's very easy to go hours sitting at your computer. Nudge tries to solve this by allowing easy creation and customization of "Nudges"/reminders that encourage you to do things at fixed intervals.

## Feature Showcase
Nudge's main feature is creating reminders at intervals

## Development Status
Development of Nudge is on and off based on how much time I have. It's generally stable, at least on the Windows computer I use. It obviously has some bugs and issues, so feel free to make an Issue if you encounter anything while using that. Also feel feww to contribute to the development of Nudge!
