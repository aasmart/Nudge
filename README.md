# Nudge
The initial vision for Nudge was an app to reduce long periods of sitting as that's [harmful for health](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/adult-health/expert-answers/sitting/faq-20058005). Consequently, Nudge provides the ability to customize, schedule, and manage reminders at fixed intervals to accomplish this. To combat notification fatigue, features such as ignored intervals (basically snoozing) are provided. Here are some uses of Nudge:
* Study breaks
* Breaks from computer
* Reminders to drink water
* And many more

Using Nudge can help you improve your mental and physical health, so get started today by going to the [latest release](https://github.com/aasmart/Nudge/releases/tag/v0.6.0) and installing Nudge!

## Feature Showcase
All nudges are displayed cleanly on a home page with muliple options for each nudge:

Creating reminders looks like the following:

Since it's easy to forget to unpause a reminder after pausing it(which is common if you need to step away from the computer), Nudge can remind you about that if you enable it!

These are the core features of the application, but there are other options to enhance the application!

## Development Status
Development of Nudge is on and off based on how much time I have. It's generally stable, at least on the Windows computer I use. It obviously has some bugs and issues, so feel free to make an Issue if you encounter anything while using that. Also feel feww to contribute to the development of Nudge!
